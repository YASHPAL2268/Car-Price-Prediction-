## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict car prices based on a dataset of car listings. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation. The final model can be used in a web application for real-time price predictions.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, outliers, and categorical feature encoding.
- **Model Training**: Compares various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses R² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE) for evaluation.
- **Interactive Interface**: Provides a simple web app for users to input car details and get price predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Web Framework**: Flask or Streamlit
- **Version Control**: Git

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YASHPAL2268/car-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd car-price-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Train the Model**: Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to train the model:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook CarPricePrediction.ipynb
   ```

2. **Make Predictions**: Use the Flask or Streamlit app to input car details and get predictions:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following features:
- Make and model
- Year of manufacture
- Engine size and type
- Mileage
- Fuel type (petrol, diesel, electric)
- Transmission (manual, automatic)
- Price (target variable)

## Model Evaluation

The performance of the model is evaluated using:
- **R² score**: Measures the goodness of fit.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average magnitude of errors.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the squared difference between predicted and actual values.
