## 🔍 How It Works

1. **User Inputs**:

   * Car brand, year, km driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission, owner type, mileage, engine capacity, max power, number of seats

2. **Encoding**:

   * All categorical inputs are converted to numerical format for ML prediction

3. **Prediction**:

   * A trained model (`model.pkl`) predicts the price of the car

4. **Output**:

   * The estimated price is displayed
   * Inputs and predicted price can be downloaded as a CSV
   * Previous predictions are saved during the session
